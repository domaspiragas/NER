Java
1. To compile the code run at the root of this project folder:
    -javac ner.java
    -java ner train.txt test.txt locs.txt WORD POSCON POS WORDCON ABBR CAP LOCATION
    (Or whatever combination of Feature Types desired (Always include WORD as the first type))
2. File names for train, test, and locs need to be paths to the file if not compiling and running from root.

This is a project I completed for a Natural Language Processing class at the University of Utah Fall of 2017

I believe the code base in this project is a good representation of clean coding practices while meeting requirements
for a project on a short deadline.
